I had nothing better to do w/ my time so I made this lol

### Music
I enjoy a lot of music. I mainly listen to hip hop and post rock, but I like quite a few other genres as well. My favorite artists are Kendrick Lamar, Death Grips, Kanye West, Swans, and Radiohead, just off the top of my head :p my favorite albums are To Pimp a Butterfly, Blonde, KIDS SEE GHOSTS, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, All Amerikkkan Bada$$, The Suburbs, We got it from here... Thank you 4 your service, IGOR, and In Rainbows, from most to least favorite (all amazing though!).

### Games
I enjoy Minecraft, I'm somewhat good at PVP, being a top 150 blitz duels player on Hypixel. I also enjoy playing Valorant, Terraria, Geometry Dash, Genshin Impact, and Bloons TD 6 quite a bit as well.
