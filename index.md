### music

my personal playlist + my top 10 songs atm, and some of my thoughts on music

[my playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/65YDXHt2dCJNvclejSRfWM?si=2bf6e34d460e4f5d)

[10: gone gone / thank you - tyler, the creator](https://open.spotify.com/track/1hz7SRTGUNAtIQ46qiNv2p?si=2f2a9b1e4cf34a44)
with this track being tyler's infamous split track, i had a lot of expectations going into this one, and they were all met tenfold. this song has amazing vocal harmonies with incredible producing - as is expected from a tyler track. it is also an incredibly important point in the narrative of igor, with him acknowledging that his love is gone and transitioning into a state of acceptance - a stark contrast to _new magic wand_ just a few tracks ago. this one is undeniably one of the more poppy tracks on this album, but i feel like it's executed beautifully and polished incredibly well.

[09: gold - brockhampton](https://open.spotify.com/track/7HRv1sYuwgoea1m0JRvChV?si=a5b6085860884a31)
gold is my favorite song in saturation - one of my favorite albums of all time. that may be saying a lot, but i feel like it's justified. gold has some of the best lyricism in the album, from kevin's catchy hook, ameer and merlin's great verses, to what i think is dom's best verse ever. the rhyming scheme is just so brockhampton that it just deserves this spot as my favorite song from this incredible boy band.
