### music

my personal playlist + my top 10 songs atm, and some of my thoughts on music

[my playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/65YDXHt2dCJNvclejSRfWM?si=2bf6e34d460e4f5d)

[10: gold - brockhampton](https://open.spotify.com/track/7HRv1sYuwgoea1m0JRvChV?si=a5b6085860884a31)
gold is my favorite song in saturation - one of my favorite albums of all time. that may be saying a lot, but i feel like it's justified. gold has some of the best lyricism in the album, from kevin's catchy hook, ameer and merlin's great verses, to what i think is dom's best verse ever. the rhyming scheme is just so brockhampton that it just deserves this spot as my favorite song from this incredible boy band.

[09: reflektor - arcade fire](https://open.spotify.com/track/7uMZy0bALAdneerERyr7Ks?si=38f8b1fe3cc94be3)
while unpopular, this song is an amazing single by arcade fire for an otherwise mediocre album. the use of haitian drums in this song coupled with arcade fire's instrumental and compositional prowess definitely seals the deal for this being one of my favorite songs ever. the way this sets up for the album to come is incredible and i feel like it's a shame that they didnt really capture the spirit that the first track had with the rest of the album. regardless of my disappointment with the album, i still love this song and it definitely warrants a place in my top 10.

[08: gone gone / thank you - tyler, the creator](https://open.spotify.com/track/1hz7SRTGUNAtIQ46qiNv2p?si=2f2a9b1e4cf34a44)
with this track being tyler's infamous split track, i had a lot of expectations going into this one, and they were all met tenfold. this song has amazing vocal harmonies with incredible producing - as is expected from a tyler track. it is also an incredibly important point in the narrative of igor, with him acknowledging that his love is gone and transitioning into a state of acceptance - a stark contrast to _new magic wand_ just a few tracks ago. this one is undeniably one of the more poppy tracks on this album, but i feel like it's executed beautifully and polished incredibly well.

[07: the suburbs - arcade fire](https://open.spotify.com/track/2UWdUez9MB9yzL7Y81Mcip?si=7e3eca40c14d4aee)
wow the second arcade fire track on my top 10, i must be a huge fan of this band. truth be told, i've never _loved_ arcade fire's discography aside from the suburbs (album, not the track) which was undeniably amazing. the opening track of this album has everything. catchy hooks, catchy choruses, catchy everything. it's ear candy to the highest degree, and it seems to do it without sacrificing the soul of the track itself. it sets up for the album incredibly well and it's an amazing opening song. took away a couple points because i've had the _sometimes i cant believee ittt - im moving past the feelin'_ stuck in my head for the good part of a year and i absolutely despise it (jokes). great track though.

[06: nights - frank ocean](https://open.spotify.com/track/7eqoqGkKwgOaWNNHx90uEZ?si=4cba679750be44e3)
nights is frank ocean's emotional masterpiece. it's the culmination of everything he's done in what is in my opinion - his best song yet. first, let's talk about the masterful use of beat switches. the constant changes in mood start to signify the day and night cycle - paying homage to the track name with it's incredibly dynamic sound and flow. second, his amazing melodies in every phase of the song only contribute to the building emotion throughout the (exactly) 5 minute track. third, just the insane amount of details and easter eggs in this track. this song is about frank's previous relationships, and the melody shift in the middle of the track perfectly divides both the album - and the song in half. it also signifies a change in his mood, both in his music and his relationship. i adore this song.
